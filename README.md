# MealTPA – Minecraft Teleportation Plugin

MealTPA is my own Minecraft plugin that adds **teleportation**, **shop**, and **mysterious NPC**.  
It’s built for **Minecraft 1.8** in Java, and makes teleportation feel like a part of the game rather than just a command.

## Features

- **Teleport Requests System** – send a teleport request to another player, and they can accept or deny it.  
- **Teleportation Totems** – special item  needed to teleport.  
- **Shop GUI** – players can buy Totems with diamonds.  
- **Unknown Seller NPC** – a mysterious merchant who opens the shop GUI when clicked, no commands needed.
